### **Most Common Scams**

#### **1. Imposter Scams**
**What It Is:** Scammers pretend to be government agencies (IRS, Social Security), companies (Amazon, Microsoft), or banks.

**Example:** "This is the Social Security Administration. Your number has been suspended due to suspicious activity. Press 1 to speak with an agent or you'll be arrested."

**Red Flags:**

**Stats:** $2.95 billion lost in 2024, $800 median loss[5]

**Image Suggestion:** Phone with fake caller ID showing "Social Security Administration"

***

#### **2. "Wrong Number" Text Scams**
**What It Is:** Random text that seems innocent ("Hey, want to get coffee?"). When you reply to say "wrong number," they start a friendly conversation that leads to romance or investment scams.

**Example:** 
- Scammer: "Hi Sarah! Looking forward to dinner tonight 😊"
- You: "Sorry, wrong number"
- Scammer: "Oh my mistake! I'm new to the area, where are you from?"
- [Weeks later]: "I've been making great money with crypto. Let me show you..."

**Stats:** $470 million lost to text scams in 2024 (5x higher than 2020)[6][7]

**Image Suggestion:** Text message screenshot showing innocent "wrong number" message

***

#### **3. Pig Butchering Scams**
**What It Is:** Long-term investment fraud. Scammer builds fake relationship (often romantic) over weeks/months, then convinces you to invest in fake cryptocurrency platform. When you try to withdraw, your money is gone.

**Why "Pig Butchering"?** Like fattening a pig before slaughter—they build trust before stealing everything.

**Example:** Meet "James" on dating app → talks daily for months → shows you his "successful" crypto investments → guides you to fake trading platform → you deposit $50k → platform shows fake profits → you try to withdraw → site disappears.

**Stats:** 
- **$5.7 billion** lost to investment scams in 2024[8][9]
- **$75 billion** lost globally 2020-2024[10]
- One bank president lost **$47 million**[9]

**Image Suggestion:** Dating app profile or fake cryptocurrency trading platform

***

#### **4. Online Shopping Scams**
**What It Is:** Fake websites, products never delivered, or items don't match description.

**Example:** See ad for designer purse at 70% off → purchase → receive cheap knockoff or nothing at all.

**Stats:** Second most reported scam category[1]

**Image Suggestion:** Fake online shopping website or "too good to be true" product ad

***

#### **5. Fake Package Delivery Texts**
**What It Is:** Text claiming issue with your package with link to "reschedule delivery" or "pay customs fee."

**Example:** "USPS: Your package is waiting. Confirm delivery: [malicious link]"

**Stats:** Most commonly reported type of text scam[11][7]

**Image Suggestion:** Fake USPS/FedEx text message

***

#### **6. Job & Employment Scams**
**What It Is:** Fake job offers, "task scams" (do simple online tasks, then asked to invest your own money), or pyramid schemes.

**Example:** "Work from home! Make $5,000/week doing simple tasks. Just pay $200 for training materials first."

**Stats:** $501 million lost in 2024 (up from $90 million in 2020)[1]

**Image Suggestion:** Fake job posting or "work from home" ad

***

#### **7. Romance Scams**
**What It Is:** Fake online dating profiles. After building emotional connection, scammer claims emergency and needs money.

**Example:** Meet online → daily messages for months → "I need $5,000 for emergency surgery" or "Help me pay for plane ticket to visit you."

**Stats:** Often linked to pig butchering; targets people seeking companionship

**Image Suggestion:** Fake dating profile with stock photo

***

#### **8. Tech Support Scams**
**What It Is:** Pop-up warning "Your computer is infected!" with phone number, or call claiming to be from Microsoft/Apple.

**Example:** Pop-up: "VIRUS DETECTED! Call 1-888-XXX-XXXX immediately!" → you call → they charge $500 to "fix" non-existent problem or install malware.

**Image Suggestion:** Fake virus warning pop-up

***

#### **9. Cryptocurrency ATM Scams**
**What It Is:** Scammer (posing as bank, government, tech support) tells you to deposit cash into Bitcoin ATM to "protect your money" or "resolve an issue."

**Example:** "This is your bank's fraud department. Someone is trying to access your account. Go to the Bitcoin ATM at your local gas station and transfer your money to this secure wallet address."

### **Slide: "Why This Matters"**
**Understanding the Full Picture:**

When you receive that "wrong number" text or investment opportunity:

❌ **Not just** some person trying to steal from you  
✅ **Reality:** Likely someone forced to send it under threat of violence

**This doesn't mean:**
- Don't protect yourself (still report and block!)
- Feel guilty for not engaging
- Send money (that only funds criminals)

**This DOES mean:**
- Have compassion for all victims
- Report scams (helps rescue trafficked workers)
- Understand the global scale of organized crime
- Support efforts to shut down these operations

**The Fight:** Law enforcement worldwide is working to:
- Rescue trafficking victims

✅ **Verify shipping addresses** - investigate last-minute address changes[3]
✅ **Multiple verification methods** - video calls + phone calls + references[3]
✅ **Share information** - report suspicious applicants to authorities[14]
✅ **Use risk matrix** - flag combinations of red flags[14]

**If You Discover One:**
- **Don't fire immediately** - they may extort/release data[7]
- Contact FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (ic3.gov)
- Secure all systems and change credentials
- Assess what data may have been accessed

**Image Suggestion:** Shield protecting company or security checklist

***

### **Slide: "The National Security Threat"**

***

### **Key Takeaways for Presentation:**
**For Church Members (Job Seekers/Employees):**
- Be skeptical of "too good to be true" remote job offers
- Verify company legitimacy before applying
- Don't download "assessment tests" from job offers
- Report suspicious job postings

**For Church Members (Business Owners/Managers):**

**The Bigger Picture:**
This isn't just about scams - it's about international sanctions evasion, weapons funding, and national security threats operating through our everyday job market.
